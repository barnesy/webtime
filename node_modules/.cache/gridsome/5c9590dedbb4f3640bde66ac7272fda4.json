Meanwhile Georgia Power formed a company, Georgia Railway and Power, and the two companies merged to become AGL’s owner. In 1927, Georgia Power separated from the merger and took AGL with it. A couple of years later, the market began to change with electricity in higher demand than natural gas. Also, piped natural gas began to replace manufactured gas. Georgia Power sold AGL in 1929.</p>\n\n      <p>Our long and winding history eventually led to Southern Company purchasing AGL Resources in 2016 and renaming it Southern Company Gas, creating the nation’s largest natural gas-only distribution company.</p>\n    </template>\n  </PageSection>\n\n  <PageSection padding=\"8rem 3rem\">\n    <Split>\n      <template>\n        <h2>Gas Gets Deregulated</h2>\n        <p>In 1997, the state of Georgia, through the Georgia General Assembly, deregulated their natural gas market, giving residents the choice to buy gas from one of several marketers.
